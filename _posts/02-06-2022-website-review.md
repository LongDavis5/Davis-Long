**Website Summary**

The website Charles Booth’s London is a digital archive dedicated to the social reformer Charles Booth. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Charles Booth wrote entries into his notebook recounting what life was like for the working class of London, which he then turned those entries into a book he named Inquiry into Life and Labor in London. The many entries he wrote over the years were integral for future historians wanting to paint a picture of what life was like in London during the late 19th century. These entries include information on the social and economic climate of London, along with poverty maps which showed the levels of poverty and wealth of people living in London.

The website incorporates the historical aspects and blends it in with modern-day technology in order to present their information. By offering the most visual representation of life in London during the late 19th century, this website is an immensely important resource for people wanting to learn more about the time period

**Website Design**

It is a very user-friendly website and contains four different sections for viewers to choose from, “Maps”, “Notebooks”, “Highlights”, and “Learn More. All of these sections include information on different aspects of Charles Booth and London and some include further subsections inside.
     
The first of the four sections is the maps, which is possibly the most important section on the website. This section allows viewers to get a direct view of London during the late 19th century, showing off the poverty and wealth levels of each street in London. Adding to this, the website also lets you compare the old London map to modern day London, allowing you to see the differences over the years.

The second section, notebooks, by far contains the bulk of information on the website. This section includes all of the entries Booth wrote into his notebook over the years, resulting in a wide array of information about religion, work industry, and the police force. These entries provide an accurate image of the living conditions and society during the time.
     
Highlights is the third section of the website and contains accounts of street life of London during late 19th century. It is a collection of notebook entries compiled in digitized form, illustrating what life was like for immigrants, prostitution, and everyday normal people. This section is important because the subsections inside allow the deepest level of inspection into the lives of Londoners.
     
Section four, Learn More, provides supplement background information on who Charles Booth was, what the book he wrote was, and information on the poverty maps and how to analyze them. This section is the most beneficial for people who are on this website and have no idea what they are looking at, allowing them to read a brief synopsis of the website’s purpose.
     
**Findings**

Because the website is so straightforward and user-friendly, it can easily be accessed by people with even the slightest level of technological skill. What I think is an important but underrated aspect of websites, is putting the sections in big, bold letters, letting viewers easily find what they are looking for, which is what this website does very well. Further, placing subsections inside the sections themselves is a fantastic idea as it allows people visiting the website to click and find specifically what they need, without having to read through paragraphs of text. Within minutes of accessing the website and clicking on different sections, I already felt comfortable and never felt lost. 
     
The information on the website is organized in an excellent, professional manner and shows why proper organization and bookkeeping is so important for a website to remain useful. The images and notebook entries paint a vivid picture of late 19th century life in London without being too in your face about it. There are not too many images getting in the way of the information, and instead are only used when providing accounts of street life. One piece of criticism I have about the website, would be to highlight the modern-day importance of Charles Booth and how show his notebook entries helped future historians in their works.
