When I first saw the TEI project and read the rubric, I was initially hesitant and slightly nervous. Though I do have a decent amount of experience in coding, it had been a long time since I had written code, especially in the HTML style. 

When I found out we were coding a small passage from Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula, I did not have a clue on how to code the proper punctuation, page breaks, or quotes from Characters, but the instructions on the rubric laid out all of the information in a way that was easy to understand and simple to convert into code. 

Seeing the passage in google docs and being able to make the edits was beneficial when converting the code into HTML. It removed much of the stress and helped me see everything I needed to accomplish in a linear way.

After I started editing the passage in HTML, being able to see all of the existing code on Oxygen helped jog my memory and I was able to remember how to properly code in HTML, which aided and made my experience much faster. I ran into a few errors while coding the project, one of which was having struggles in adding an em-dash. I did not know where the em-dash went and it took a couple tries until I situated it in the right spot.

Being able to work on this project is one of the many reasons why I enjoy being a Digital Humanities minor. Because DH projects encompasses many different fields, I have been able to expand my knowledge in what I do and do not know. Having a big interest in computers and especially coding itself, this project has helped me strengthen my skills and further taught me new information which will help a lot in my future.
