Before coming into this class, I was fortunate enough to have a background and solid understanding of the Digital Humanities field. This semester was incredibly beneficial in broadening my definition and changed how I view the field. Being able to see the plethora of different projects Digital Humanities encompasses further showed me how diverse the field is. One of my favorite aspects of the field is the high level of user involvement in the projects, as it really shows there is an infinite number of projects for people to choose from. It is interesting to see how in-depth some of the Digital Humanities projects are as the information found on the websites ranges so wide.

Digital Humanities opens up avenues for data collection in ways that no other field can. From being able to view Charles Booth’s London and see the poverty levels of 19th century England to “Dracula’s Guest” and coding a segment from the book, I was able to interact and expand what I already knew and did not know. Although these projects were just a small sample size on the ocean of projects, it gave me deeper insight into the field in ways I never thought possible. Furthermore, being able to create our own Digital Humanities projects was a very helpful method to learn as we were interacting and editing firsthand, getting much better experience.

The readings were all supplemental in adding to what I did not previously know. This ranged from how to not write a shitty first draft to what makes a good Digital Humanities project. The reading I enjoyed the best and was most beneficial to me was “Why Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals” as I had never written a grant before and I did not know there was a big stylistic difference in writing. It helped me narrow down how I should format my grant proposal and how to get readers more interested in what I am proposing.

Even though it was not a reading, the resumé help on the google drive was incredibly helpful to me as I am currently applying to jobs after I graduate this May. I did not realize before that I had my wording wrong in the tasks I completed at previous jobs, and also included some of the wrong dates and font sizes.

This semester, by far my favorite project was the Grant Assignment, where we had to come up with a project idea and write a grant proposal on why it should be funded. This project was very helpful as I was gaining experience in a field I had never been involved with prior. Additionally, it honed my skills in finding and sorting sources to pick which information would be most useful to my grant proposal.
One of the things I struggled with my grant proposal was finding scholarly articles. Because I decided to propose a fictional digital mapping of a planet in Star Wars, there were not many sources I could find that could assist me. Instead, I mainly researched how other mappings in the Digital Humanities field are created and the steps needed to ensure my mapping follows along the guidelines.

Another aspect of this class I enjoyed heavily was the four research blogs we had to create. As I am interested in coding and see a future in it, Github was a valuable resource in allowing me to customize my blogs to appear more polished. This was also the first time I have ever written a blog post, and in doing so, I became more confident in my own writing as I knew other classmates would be viewing my blog.
A big reason why I enjoyed the blogs so much was the bits of coding involved, but also that we were able to create our own blog entirely and could edit and customize it to our choosing. The website review blog was my favorite as it involved actual research of another Digital Humanities project. 

Overall, this class was one of my favorite and most helpful to me as I improved many aspects of my writing, coding, and researching. I was looking at projects that blew my mind away and had no idea it was possible for them to be created, and it really shows the complexity and variety involved with the field. Digital Humanities is a great field for people to improve their skills or find a project on a study they are interested about and want to learn more on. I am fortunate enough to say I was able to be involved with the Digital Humanities field during my time in college as the field is growing and will hopefully be found more in education.
